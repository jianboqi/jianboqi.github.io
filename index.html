        <h1>LESS</h1>
        <p stype="text-align:justify;">A ray-tracing based 3D radiative transfer model developed since 2013, which is mainly designed for radiometric simulation over heteregeneous 3D scenes. It can simulate remote sensing signal including multispectral/hyperspectral images, hyperspectral LiDAR waveform/point cloud, solar induced fluorescense, etc., over large-scale (e.g. > 1 km) scenes. LESS provides user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) as well as <a href="http://lessrt.org/docs/documentation/" target="blank">Python SDK</a> for manipulating 3D scenes, performing simulations and processing simulations products.</p>
        <p stype="text-align:justify;">LESS是基于光线追踪异质地表三维辐射传输模型（计算机模拟模型），可用于复杂森林、城市等地表结构下的多光谱、高光谱、激光雷达、热红外、叶绿素荧光等遥感数据，以及三维光分布、光合作用等数据的模拟。</p>

            <blockquote>
              <p>LESS is a ray-tracing based 3D radiative transfer model, which can simulate remote sensing data and images over large-scale and realistic 3D scenes. LESS employs a weighted forward photon tracing (FPT) method to simulate multispectral bidirectional reflectance factor (BRF) or flux-related data (e.g., downwelling radiation) and a backward path tracing (BPT) method to generate sensor images (e.g., fisheye images) or large-scale (e.g. 1 km2) spectral images. The BPT also has been extended to simulate thermal infrared radiation by using an on-the-fly computation of the sunlit and shaded scene components. It also provides a user-friendly graphic user interface (GUI) and a set of tools to help construct the landscape and set parameters. The accuracy of LESS is evaluated with other models as well as field measurements in terms of directional BRFs and pixel-wise simulated image comparisons, which shows very good agreement. LESS can work on both single computer and computing clusters. LESS is developed with Java, Python and C++. LESS is released under the GPLv3 license, its code can be found at github <a href="https://github.com/jianboqi/lessrt" target="_blank">lessrt</a>.</p>

            <p>LESS provides an easy-to-use GUI, which manages all the input parameters, performs batch processings and visualizes 3D scenes before acutal computation. It also provides some functionalities to help construct
                3D scenes (e.g., Ground filtering, Individual tree detection...).
