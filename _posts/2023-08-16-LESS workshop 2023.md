August 16-18, 2023

The second edition of the LESS Model Workshop and Training Seminar was successfully organized from August 16th to 18th, 2023. Following the inaugural event in 2021, this seminar served as a pivotal platform, delving into a spectrum of topics encompassing vegetation reflectance simulation, LiDAR simulation, fluorescence simulation, and scene construction with LESS.

The seminar witnessed a notable participation of 350 individuals, both online and offline. Notably, 50 attendees engaged in the seminar physically, while the remaining 300 joined virtually from diverse geographical locations. This substantial attendance underlined the growing interest and engagement in exploring and implementing advanced modeling techniques in the realm of remote sensing studies.

Experts and participants convened to delve into the intricacies of simulating various environmental aspects, fostering insightful discussions and knowledge sharing. The hands-on sessions provided a practical understanding of modeling techniques, equipping attendees with valuable skills essential for contemporary research and application.

The organizing committee expressed gratitude to all participants, speakers, and contributors, affirming the commitment to continue organizing such impactful and enlightening events in the future, furthering the boundaries of remote sensing research and application.
