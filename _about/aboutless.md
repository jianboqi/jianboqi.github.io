#### The development history of LESS
The LESS model has been under development since 2013. A preliminary version was completed in 2017, followed by the official release of a fully functional version in 2019. Since then, continuous research and improvement efforts have been ongoing. Currently, LESS has been frequently used in remote sensing modeling and inversion, forestry, agricultrue, ecology and other fields.
